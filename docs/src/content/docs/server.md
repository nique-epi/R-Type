title: Server and game
description: What the server program and the game library do, how their parts fit together and where to find them in the code.
---

The server, `r-type_server`, is meant to run the game for the players connected to it. Today it receives their datagrams and runs a tick at a fixed rate, but a tick only logs the datagrams received and counts toward the next world state: nothing decodes them or advances the `World`, and no one is on the recipient list, so no state is sent yet. It never links SFML or Asio: it reaches the network through `rtype_network`, and its own libraries are checked for it at configure time (see [Project layout](/R-Type/project-layout/#who-may-link-what)).

The game library, `rtype_game`, holds the rules of a match: what moves, what touches what and what that means. It is built on the engine (see [Engine](/R-Type/engine/)), and it knows nothing about sockets, SFML or the messages sent between the programs (see [Project layout](/R-Type/project-layout/#game)). The server runs all of it; the client will only run the part that predicts its own ship.

This page tells you where to look when you need to change something. It describes what exists today and says plainly what does not exist yet.

## Launch options: `LaunchOptions`

`LaunchOptions` (`src/server/LaunchOptions/`) reads what the server is told at launch. `main()` first reads the logging options (see [Logging](/R-Type/logging/#choosing-the-level-and-the-output-at-launch)), then hands the other arguments to `LaunchOptions::read()`, which reads them with the engine's `readLaunchArguments` (see [Engine](/R-Type/engine/#launch-arguments-readlauncharguments)):

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-p <port>` | The UDP port to listen on, from 1 to 65535 (see [Network](/R-Type/network/#ports-and-addresses-written-as-text-portfromtext-ipv4addressfromtext)). Default: `DEFAULT_SERVER_PORT` (4242). |
| `--help` | Prints the usage, the logging options included, on standard output, then exits with code 0 without starting anything or opening the journal. |

- The server listens on every IPv4 interface (`ANY_IPV4_ADDRESS`) and takes no address: `-h`, the client's address option, is an unknown argument here. The last `-p` wins.
- An unknown argument, a `-p` without a value or an invalid port stops the server before anything starts: it prints `r-type_server:`, the reason and how to see the usage on standard error, then exits with code 1.

```bash
./r-type_server -p 4243
```

## Threads: `ServerApplication`

`ServerApplication` (`src/server/Application/ServerApplication/`) runs the server on two threads, which never share game state:

- The **network thread**, the one that calls `run()`, runs the `NetworkContext`. `DatagramRelay` (`rtype_network`, see [Network](/R-Type/network/#socket-to-queues-datagramrelay)) copies every datagram received, with its sender, into the incoming `BoundedQueue`, and sends what was left in the outgoing one. It is the only thread that touches the socket.
- The **simulation thread** runs `SIMULATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND` (60) ticks per second. Each tick drains the incoming queue and hands what arrived, often nothing, to the tick handler given to the constructor, so a slow or silent player never holds the game up. At the end of the tick it asks the network thread, through `NetworkContext::post()`, to send the outgoing queue.

The tick handler is where the game plugs in. Today `src/server/main.cpp` gives one that logs each datagram at the `debug` level, then calls the `WorldStateSender`: nothing decodes or answers the datagrams, and the sender has no recipient, so nothing fills the outgoing queue yet.

A tick handler puts a datagram in the outgoing queue with `queueDatagram()`, called from the handler itself, on the simulation thread. The datagram is sent at the end of the same tick.

Anyone can send a datagram, so the tick handler must drop and count a datagram it cannot decode, and never let an exception caused by a datagram's content escape: an exception stops the server (see below), so one truncated datagram would stop it for every player. `ByteReader`, for instance, throws `BufferUnderflowException` when a datagram is shorter than what it reads.

The queues hold `INCOMING_DATAGRAM_QUEUE_CAPACITY` and `OUTGOING_DATAGRAM_QUEUE_CAPACITY` (256) datagrams each (`src/server/ServerConstants.hpp`). These sizes are **provisional**: about one second of the inputs of four players, they will be revised with the rates of the protocol. Code must read the constants.

- When more datagrams arrive between two ticks than the incoming queue holds, the oldest are discarded. Every `TICKS_PER_REPORT` ticks (600, so every ten seconds), the server logs a warning with how many were discarded, if any.
- Nothing filters the senders yet: one sender flooding the port pushes the other senders' datagrams out of the incoming queue (see [Flood protection](#flood-protection)).
- The outgoing queue also discards its oldest datagram when full, but nothing reports it yet.

`stop()` makes `run()` return, from any thread: the network thread stops at once, the simulation thread when its current sleep ends, about one tick later. An exception thrown on either thread, by the tick handler for instance, stops both, and `run()` rethrows it.

### Flood protection

The room of the incoming queue protects the server's memory, not the players: one sender flooding the server's port pushes everyone else's datagrams out of it. A plain Python loop on the loopback address sends about 3 800 datagrams per tick (measured on an Apple Silicon laptop), about fifteen times the room of the queue. Other engines protect the players in three layers; the server must have them once sessions exist, and **none is written yet**:

1. **Sort on the network thread, before the queue.** A datagram whose sender has no session and that is not a `ConnectionRequest` must be dropped there, and connection requests must be limited per address, in a table of fixed size so that forged addresses cannot make it grow. Quake 3 ignores such datagrams and answers at most 10 status, information or remote console requests per second from one address; Unreal limits how many datagrams of senders without a connection it processes each frame.
2. **One queue per session**, so a flooding client only fills its own. Valve's GameNetworkingSockets keeps one per connection, of 1 000 messages by default.
3. **One input per player and per tick.** The protocol already requires it: the server must apply the newest `PlayerInput` of each player at every tick and ignore older ones (see [Protocol](/R-Type/protocol/#inputs)).

The shared queue stays as the last safety net. It discards its oldest datagram, where GameNetworkingSockets refuses the newest, because only the newest input of a player counts. Why threads only talk through queues is explained in [Architecture](/R-Type/architecture/#queues-between-threads).

## Tick loop: `TickLoop`

`TickLoop` (`src/server/Application/TickLoop/`) calls a function once per tick on the thread that runs it. It counts ticks with a `FixedTimestep` and sleeps until its `nextTickTime()`, so the average rate stays at 60 ticks per second: after a late wake-up the missed ticks run back to back, and a stall longer than `MAXIMUM_TICKS_PER_ADVANCE` (5) ticks drops the excess. `ServerApplication` creates it when `run()` starts, so the first tick is due one tick after the call.

The limit is a choice for this game: during a longer stall the game freezes, then resumes where it stopped. Catching the whole stall up would play it in an instant, a second of enemy fire that nobody saw coming. Engines differ on it: a Quake 3 dedicated server catches up to 5 seconds, so that the clients' view of the server's clock stays right; Unity lets each game set its `maximumDeltaTime`.

Every `TICKS_PER_REPORT` ticks, the loop logs at the `debug` level how late its ticks started, each compared with the moment it was due; a dropped stall shows in full. The journal is `r-type_server.log`; `--log-stderr` also prints it in the terminal (see [Logging](/R-Type/logging/#choosing-the-level-and-the-output-at-launch)):

```bash
./r-type_server --log-level debug --log-stderr
```

After the time stamp, the line reads:

```
[DEBUG] [Simulation] - 600 ticks started on average 4.43782 ms late, at most 8.32842 ms
```

Every stall that drops game time is counted, and the same report then adds a warning, shown at the default level: how many stalls dropped game time since the previous report, how much in total, and the longest. Measured on a server paused for one second:

```
[WARN ] [Simulation] - stalls since the previous report: 1, game time dropped: 939.018 ms, the longest: 939.018 ms; the game froze instead of catching up
```

Repeated at every report, it means that the server keeps falling behind, for instance because its ticks take longer to run than the 16.7 ms each one stands for.

How late a tick starts depends on how precisely the system wakes a sleeping thread:

- On Windows, MSVC's `sleep_for` ends in `Sleep`, whose documentation says that a wait longer than one tick of the system clock but shorter than two "can be anywhere between one and two ticks". While it runs, the loop holds a `FineTimerResolution` (`src/server/Platform/`), which asks Windows for `FINE_TIMER_RESOLUTION_MILLISECONDS` (1 ms). If Windows refuses, the loop logs a warning and runs anyway.
- On macOS, measured on an Apple Silicon laptop, a sleep wakes later the longer it is: 0.5 ms late on average for a 1 ms sleep, 5.6 ms for a 16.7 ms sleep. Timer coalescing, enabled on that machine, is the likely cause. Over several 30-second runs, ticks started 3.8 to 4.5 ms late on average and at most 9.1 ms late, with no client as with four clients sending 60 datagrams per second each, and 600 ticks still ran every ten seconds.
- On Linux and Windows, the lateness is not measured yet.

## World state: `WorldStateSender`

`WorldStateSender` (`src/server/Replication/WorldStateSender/`) sends the state of the game to the players, at a fixed rate. The tick handler calls `onTick(components, recipients)` once per tick, on the simulation thread. The sender counts the ticks, and every `TICKS_PER_WORLD_STATE` (3) of them, that is `WORLD_STATES_PER_SECOND` (20) times per second, it lists every entity that has a `NetworkIdentity`, a `Position` and an `EntityType`, has `WorldStateCodec` encode the list (see [Network](/R-Type/network/#world-state-worldstatecodec)), and hands one `OutgoingDatagram` per recipient and per payload to the function it was given. In `main.cpp` that function is `queueDatagram()`.

- The `tick` of a state is the number of ticks the sender has counted, so the first state carries tick 3 and the client can tell which of two states is newer. The counter is 32 bits and is not made to wrap: it takes 2.27 years at 60 ticks per second.
- `WORLD_STATES_PER_SECOND` is **provisional**: it will be revised once measured on a real network. It must divide the tick rate, and the build fails otherwise. Code must read the constants, `TICKS_PER_WORLD_STATE` for instance, and never repeat the 3.
- Nothing is built when the list of recipients is empty. An entity without a network id, or without a type, is not listed.
- An entity whose position is not a finite number (NaN or infinite), which only a game bug can produce, is left out of the state instead of stopping the server. A warning under the `Replication` module gives how many entities were left out, each time that number changes, so a stuck entity is reported once rather than 20 times per second.
- The state lists no player yet: the game has no lives, score or player numbers. Nothing gives an entity a `NetworkIdentity` yet either, so the real server lists nothing until something spawns networked entities.
- The datagrams hold the bare message payload, without the packet header, so no client could accept them yet.
- A playfield larger than 2047 logical units in either direction fails the build, because a wire coordinate would no longer hold it (see [Protocol](/R-Type/protocol/#positions)).

```cpp
rtype::server::ServerApplication* serverPointer = nullptr;
rtype::server::WorldStateSender worldStateSender{
    [&serverPointer](rtype::network::OutgoingDatagram datagram) {
      serverPointer->queueDatagram(std::move(datagram));
    }};
rtype::server::ServerApplication server{
    endpoint, [&worldStateSender, &world,
               &recipients](std::span<const rtype::network::IncomingDatagram>) {
      worldStateSender.onTick(world.components(), recipients);
    }};
serverPointer = &server;
```

The sender is built before the server, whose tick handler captures it, and sends through the server, so a pointer set once the server exists closes the loop; it is set before `run()` starts the simulation thread.

`World::components()` (`rtype_game`) is the `ComponentRegistry` of the world: a `World` owns its entities and their components, and cannot be copied or moved.

## Collisions

A collision takes two steps, in two classes. The first finds what overlaps; the second decides which overlaps matter. Neither removes health nor destroys an entity: they only announce what happened, so the damage rules can react to it (see [Event bus](/R-Type/engine/#event-bus-eventbus)).

### Detection: `CollisionSystem`

`CollisionSystem` (`src/game/Systems/CollisionSystem/`, an `ISystem`) looks at every entity that has a `Position` and a `CollisionBox`. A `CollisionBox` is a size in logical units, centered on the `Position`. For each pair of boxes that overlap, it publishes one `Collision` (the engine event, see [Collisions](/R-Type/engine/#collisions-bounds-overlaps-and-collision)).

- Each overlapping pair is published once per update. Which of the two entities comes first carries no meaning.
- Boxes that only touch along an edge or at a corner do not overlap.
- An entity without a `Position` or without a `CollisionBox` is never reported.
- Every pair is tested, so the cost grows with the square of the number of boxes. The list of boxes is kept between updates, so a steady state allocates nothing.
- `update()` only queues the events. The loop must call `EventBus::dispatch()` after the systems, and run `CollisionSystem` after `MovementSystem`, so the boxes are tested where the entities now are.

### Rules: `CollisionRules`

`CollisionRules` (`src/game/Systems/CollisionRules/`) subscribes to `Collision` when it is created and unsubscribes when it is destroyed. For each `Collision` it reads the `EntityType` of both entities, in whichever order they come, and publishes a game event for three pairs only:

| Pair | Published |
|---|---|
| `PlayerMissile` and `Enemy` | `MissileHit{missile, target}`, the target being the enemy |
| `EnemyMissile` and `Player` | `MissileHit{missile, target}`, the target being the player |
| `Player` and `Enemy` | `ShipContact{player, enemy}` |

Every other pair is ignored: a player missile does not hurt a player, two enemies do not hurt each other, two missiles do not stop each other. An entity without an `EntityType`, or destroyed between the moment the `Collision` was published and the moment it is delivered, is ignored too.

The events are structs in `src/game/Events/`. `MissileHit` and `ShipContact` say that a contact happened; what it costs is left to the damage rules, which do not exist yet.

```cpp
rtype::engine::EventBus events;
rtype::game::CollisionRules rules{events, components};

scheduler.add(std::make_unique<rtype::game::MovementSystem>());
scheduler.add(std::make_unique<rtype::game::CollisionSystem>(events));

events.subscribe<rtype::game::MissileHit>([](const rtype::game::MissileHit& hit) {
  // remove health from hit.target, destroy hit.missile
});

scheduler.run(components, SIMULATION_TICK_DURATION);
events.dispatch();
```

The bus and the registry must outlive `CollisionRules`, and the bus must outlive `CollisionSystem`. The game loop that would create them does not exist yet: today only the tests build this chain.

Each folder holding sources has its own `CMakeLists.txt` declaring one library; `Application/` and `Platform/` only add their subfolders, `Replication/` declares its constants and adds `WorldStateSender/`, and `r-type_server` links `rtype_server_application`, `rtype_server_launch_options` and `rtype_server_world_state_sender` in `src/server/CMakeLists.txt`.
