title: Server and game
description: What the server program and the game library do, how their parts fit together and where to find them in the code.
---

The server, `r-type_server`, runs the game for the players connected to it: it receives their datagrams and advances the game at a fixed rate; sending the state back to them is not written yet. It never links SFML or Asio: it reaches the network through `rtype_network`, and its own libraries are checked for it at configure time (see [Project layout](/R-Type/project-layout/#who-may-link-what)).

The game library, `rtype_game`, holds the rules of a match: what moves, what touches what and what that means. It is built on the engine (see [Engine](/R-Type/engine/)), and it knows nothing about sockets, SFML or the messages sent between the programs (see [Project layout](/R-Type/project-layout/#game)). The server runs all of it; the client will only run the part that predicts its own ship.

This page tells you where to look when you need to change something. It describes what exists today and says plainly what does not exist yet.

## Threads: `ServerApplication`

`ServerApplication` (`src/server/Application/ServerApplication/`) runs the server on two threads, which never share game state:

- The **network thread**, the one that calls `run()`, runs the `NetworkContext`. `DatagramRelay` (`rtype_network`, see [Network](/R-Type/network/#socket-to-queues-datagramrelay)) copies every datagram received, with its sender, into the incoming `BoundedQueue`, and sends what was left in the outgoing one. It is the only thread that touches the socket.
- The **simulation thread** runs `SIMULATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND` (60) ticks per second. Each tick drains the incoming queue and hands what arrived, often nothing, to the tick handler given to the constructor, so a slow or silent player never holds the game up. At the end of the tick it asks the network thread, through `NetworkContext::post()`, to send the outgoing queue.

The tick handler is where the game plugs in. Today `src/server/main.cpp` gives one that logs each datagram at the `debug` level: nothing decodes or answers them yet, and nothing fills the outgoing queue.

The queues hold `INCOMING_DATAGRAM_QUEUE_CAPACITY` and `OUTGOING_DATAGRAM_QUEUE_CAPACITY` (256) datagrams each (`src/server/ServerConstants.hpp`). These sizes are **provisional**: about one second of the inputs of four players, they will be revised with the rates of the protocol. Code must read the constants.

- When more datagrams arrive between two ticks than the incoming queue holds, the oldest are discarded. Every `TICKS_PER_REPORT` ticks (600, so every ten seconds), the server logs a warning with how many were discarded, if any.
- Nothing filters the senders yet: one sender flooding the port pushes the other senders' datagrams out of the incoming queue.
- The outgoing queue also discards its oldest datagram when full, but nothing reports it yet.

`stop()` makes `run()` return, from any thread: the network thread stops at once, the simulation thread when its current sleep ends, about one tick later. An exception thrown on either thread, by the tick handler for instance, stops both, and `run()` rethrows it.

## Tick loop: `TickLoop`

`TickLoop` (`src/server/Application/TickLoop/`) calls a function once per tick on the thread that runs it. It counts ticks with a `FixedTimestep` and sleeps until its `nextTickTime()`, so the average rate stays at 60 ticks per second: after a late wake-up the missed ticks run back to back, and a stall longer than `MAXIMUM_TICKS_PER_ADVANCE` (5) ticks drops the excess. `ServerApplication` creates it when `run()` starts, so the first tick is due one tick after the call.

The limit is a choice for this game: during a longer stall the game freezes, then resumes where it stopped. Catching the whole stall up would play it in an instant, a second of enemy fire that nobody saw coming. Engines differ on it: a Quake 3 dedicated server catches up to 5 seconds, so that the clients' view of the server's clock stays right; Unity lets each game set its `maximumDeltaTime`.

Every `TICKS_PER_REPORT` ticks, the loop logs at the `debug` level how late its ticks started, each compared with the moment it was due; a dropped stall shows in full. The journal is `r-type_server.log`; `--log-stderr` also prints it in the terminal (see [Logging](/R-Type/logging/#choosing-the-level-and-the-output-at-launch)):

```bash
./r-type_server --log-level debug --log-stderr
```

After the time stamp, the line reads:

```
[DEBUG] [Simulation] - 600 ticks started on average 4.43782 ms late, at most 8.32842 ms
```

Every stall that drops game time is counted, and the same report then adds a warning, shown at the default level: how many stalls dropped game time since the previous report, how much in total, and the longest. Measured on a server paused for one second:

```
[WARN ] [Simulation] - stalls since the previous report: 1, game time dropped: 939.018 ms, the longest: 939.018 ms; the game froze instead of catching up
```

Repeated at every report, it means that the server keeps falling behind, for instance because its ticks take longer to run than the 16.7 ms each one stands for.

How late a tick starts depends on how precisely the system wakes a sleeping thread:

- On Windows, MSVC's `sleep_for` ends in `Sleep`, whose documentation says that a wait longer than one tick of the system clock but shorter than two "can be anywhere between one and two ticks". While it runs, the loop holds a `FineTimerResolution` (`src/server/Platform/`), which asks Windows for `FINE_TIMER_RESOLUTION_MILLISECONDS` (1 ms). If Windows refuses, the loop logs a warning and runs anyway.
- On macOS, measured on an Apple Silicon laptop, a sleep wakes later the longer it is: 0.5 ms late on average for a 1 ms sleep, 5.6 ms for a 16.7 ms sleep. Timer coalescing, enabled on that machine, is the likely cause. Over several 30-second runs, ticks started 3.8 to 4.5 ms late on average and at most 9.1 ms late, with no client as with four clients sending 60 datagrams per second each, and 600 ticks still ran every ten seconds.
- On Linux and Windows, the lateness is not measured yet.

## Collisions

A collision takes two steps, in two classes. The first finds what overlaps; the second decides which overlaps matter. Neither removes health nor destroys an entity: they only announce what happened, so the damage rules can react to it (see [Event bus](/R-Type/engine/#event-bus-eventbus)).

### Detection: `CollisionSystem`

`CollisionSystem` (`src/game/Systems/CollisionSystem/`, an `ISystem`) looks at every entity that has a `Position` and a `CollisionBox`. A `CollisionBox` is a size in logical units, centered on the `Position`. For each pair of boxes that overlap, it publishes one `Collision` (the engine event, see [Collisions](/R-Type/engine/#collisions-bounds-overlaps-and-collision)).

- Each overlapping pair is published once per update. Which of the two entities comes first carries no meaning.
- Boxes that only touch along an edge or at a corner do not overlap.
- An entity without a `Position` or without a `CollisionBox` is never reported.
- Every pair is tested, so the cost grows with the square of the number of boxes. The list of boxes is kept between updates, so a steady state allocates nothing.
- `update()` only queues the events. The loop must call `EventBus::dispatch()` after the systems, and run `CollisionSystem` after `MovementSystem`, so the boxes are tested where the entities now are.

### Rules: `CollisionRules`

`CollisionRules` (`src/game/Systems/CollisionRules/`) subscribes to `Collision` when it is created and unsubscribes when it is destroyed. For each `Collision` it reads the `EntityType` of both entities, in whichever order they come, and publishes a game event for three pairs only:

| Pair | Published |
|---|---|
| `PlayerMissile` and `Enemy` | `MissileHit{missile, target}`, the target being the enemy |
| `EnemyMissile` and `Player` | `MissileHit{missile, target}`, the target being the player |
| `Player` and `Enemy` | `ShipContact{player, enemy}` |

Every other pair is ignored: a player missile does not hurt a player, two enemies do not hurt each other, two missiles do not stop each other. An entity without an `EntityType`, or destroyed between the moment the `Collision` was published and the moment it is delivered, is ignored too.

The events are structs in `src/game/Events/`. `MissileHit` and `ShipContact` say that a contact happened; what it costs is left to the damage rules, which do not exist yet.

```cpp
rtype::engine::EventBus events;
rtype::game::CollisionRules rules{events, components};

scheduler.add(std::make_unique<rtype::game::MovementSystem>());
scheduler.add(std::make_unique<rtype::game::CollisionSystem>(events));

events.subscribe<rtype::game::MissileHit>([](const rtype::game::MissileHit& hit) {
  // remove health from hit.target, destroy hit.missile
});

scheduler.run(components, SIMULATION_TICK_DURATION);
events.dispatch();
```

The bus and the registry must outlive `CollisionRules`, and the bus must outlive `CollisionSystem`. The game loop that would create them does not exist yet: today only the tests build this chain.
